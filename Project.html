            <p>
                Worked on the digital factory team at 3M Brookings, worked with various tools such as SQL and Oracle for database
                management and also using automation software such as Workflow and Wonderware to communicate to the machines. 
                Also worked on developing several tools to speed up the process for employees work but automating 
                things like Excel to Json using tools like pandas.

                This is my personal website that uses HTML, CSS and Javascript for web design. 
                This website will always be a work in progress as I learn more things to incorporate into it and 
                new updates about my life have occured. This personal website is also the first step for me to learn more
                about full stack development. I hope to move on from this project to learn more backend and databases and come 
                up with a cool new chat app.

            <p >
                This is a python program that uses a pre-exisiting Facial Detection Library to detect faces from a webcam
                using OpenCv. My goals with this project are to make my own CNN with my own provided data to make a machine learning model
                to replace the Facial Deteciton Library as it has some limitations that I would like to improve on.
